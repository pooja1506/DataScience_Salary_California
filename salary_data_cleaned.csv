"Data Scientist / Software Engineer, Planner",$155K-$247K (Glassdoor Est.),"Waymo is a self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they're going. Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the World's Most Experienced Driver in hopes of improving the world's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 15 billion miles of simulation testing.

The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: building algorithms to assess the safety and quality of our self-driving cars at scale. Evaluation at scale is of paramount importance in solving autonomous driving: the algorithms we build orient the development of planner software by defining the north star and thus enabling rapid iteration. Almost every improvement to Waymo's planner is influenced by our work, indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) or directly (by incorporating our algorithms into our onboard motion planning code). This is no easy feat. As our self-driving car gets better and accumulates more miles, we need rigorous and intelligent methods to automatically assess whether a scene is risky, a maneuver causes discomfort, or an interaction with pedestrians or other drivers could be managed better. This can be done through geometric reasoning, simulation, machine learning, and/or modeling with statistical distributions. Developing evaluation algorithms in self-driving is an uncharted space and thus requires true ingenuity. If you are excited about leveraging a large volume of extremely rich data in an area with lots of unexplored territory to help the advent of self-driving technology, this is the place for you!

In this hybrid role, you will:
Develop signals to describe the quality of our self driving car's behavior, using a range of techniques including machine learning, statistics, math, and physics
Design creative uses of simulation to measure those signals
Work closely with statisticians, machine learning engineers, and roboticists to develop novel solutions to open problems
We'd like you to have:
MS in Computer Science, Robotics, Statistics, Physics, Math or another quantitative area
3 years of industry experience
Python especially for modeling and/or statistical computing
Experience with tools for manipulating big data
Experience with machine learning or large scale statistical analysis
Problem-oriented mindset instead of only a solutions-oriented approach

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas.

Retool’s user base is growing quickly, and we’ve found ourselves with an increasing number of questions about our business and product. We’re looking to hire our first Data Scientist to take the lead on analysis and metrics to inform our product, what’s working, and what’s not. Today this work is spread across teams, with our Growth team the primary driver.

We’re looking for someone who is passionate about analyzing data across all domains, motivated by having an impact on the business and is constantly curious. This is the right role for someone who thrives in the blurry space that is data at high growth startup.

WHAT YOU'LL DO
As the first hire in this role you’ll play a pivotal role in building the data culture at Retool.

We’ll look to you to help us establish KPIs and ensure we have the tooling to measure and access said KPIs. You’ll apply your statistical knowledge to the data questions we face today around product analytics and pricing, and help us think critically about the questions of tomorrow.

You’ll also take on ownership of our data stack to ensure that your teammates are able to access the data they need to make decisions and technical teams are able to quickly implement events. We’ve already built out a solid stack on top of Segment, BigQuery, DBT and, of course, Retool, but we need your help to ensure it scales with the company.

Retool is a small but fast growing startup with more questions than answers and we’re looking for someone who is excited to wear many hats and jump in wherever is needed. This means each day will be a little different and we’ll look to you to juggle a variety of projects and deadlines. We are looking for someone who has a bias towards finding a way forward on impactful work.


WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
You’ll work most closely with Retool’s Growth team, but really you’ll work with almost every team at the company. You’ll be expected to partner closely with internal stakeholders, and help identify areas of need and opportunity within the organization.

THE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING:
3+ years of experience working with product analytics and an engineering team.
Highly skilled at writing SQL. A strong enthusiasm for SQL, in all its flavors, is a plus.
Experience working with, or a healthy interest in and knowledge of, event driven infrastructure and ETL processes.
Knowledge of common git workflows.
A solution-oriented growth mindset.
Demonstrated experience partnering with cross-functional stakeholders.
Strong communication and presentation skills.
IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:
Work with product and business (marketing, sales, success, support) teams to identify key questions and answer them with data.
Develop key metrics and ensure observability via dashboards and other relevant tooling.
Apply analytical skills to understand user behavior.
Regularly communicate learnings to the company.
Lead the collection and modeling of data in our warehouse — from new sources to integrating existing sources.

Define tracking best practices.
Be a self starter.

Data Scientist (Natural Language Processing),$118K-$188K (Glassdoor Est.),"Create the model that transforms the mortgage industry


Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.

Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our document parsing data science team


We're looking for someone who is fired up to automate the manual labor currently associated with ingesting, reviewing, and reconciling the dozens of types of documents that need comprehension during a real estate transaction. This means everything from using advanced optical character recognition techniques to parse scanned documents, to using natural language processing to check their validity and action them.

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at Oracle, PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?
3-10 years of relevant experience in data science
Excitement about delivering industry-shaking document parsing algorithms using natural language processing (NLP)
Experience in document processing is a plus, but not required: we will consider all accomplished persons in any area of NLP
Strengths aligned with our needs
E.g. Can you explain how convolutional kernels or attention mechanisms work without making reference to computers?
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
We want to help you do the best work of your life

Data Scientist,$118K-$188K (Glassdoor Est.),"Who you are

The first Data Scientist at Finrise will play an imperative role in enabling patient financing for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. You recognize that 56% of Americans with a less than ideal FICO Score need new ways to evaluate creditworthiness in efficient and holistic ways. You’re excited about tackling technical problems that most wouldn’t dare touch. Working with unstructured and nontraditional data doesn’t scare you. Data science, predictive models, and statistics are second nature. You excel in building machine learning systems, conducting foolproof analyses, and leading cross functional projects. While banks are busy evaluating 30-year-old FICO scores, created before a time of the internet and smartphones, you’re building models which will decide who to lend to in real-time. Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

What you'll be doing
Designing and developing core machine learning infrastructure
Conducting statistical analyses to assess the value of new data points and vendors
Building and deploying production risk models to improve Finrise patient underwriting
Hiring and leading a team of best-in-class data scientists

We are an early stage start-up developing technology and data intelligence

underlying radically more efficient logistics businesses. Serving the $730bn US motor

freight market, Haulistix has been developed with the ambition to create a hyper growth

business. The company leverages the latest operations research, data and machine

intelligence at scale to have a real-life impact on the operational and financial

performance of hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized trucking companies.

To achieve this, we pay equal attention to developing cutting-edge technology,

understanding real-life user behavior and creating innovative business models

Using machine intelligence, we arrange single truck loads from across the freight

market into highly profitable freight trips and sell them to small and medium-sized

trucking companies.

By doing this, we digitize the cognitively most challenging aspects of a motor

carriers' dispatch function and attack their tremendous inefficiency at one of its

root causes.

Unlike with simple load bookings directly through brokers or expensive software

solutions, we offer carriers and brokers access to cutting-edge technology whilst

materially improving their profitability one business transaction at a time.

Role

We are currently hiring Data Scientists and Data Engineers to become part of the

first ten employees of our company and core members of our early-stage team. Working

directly with the founders, the data scientists/engineers will be interfacing cross-

functionally with our technology development team, relevant academic advisers, our in-

house operations team as well as external contractors and select clients. Key focus of

our early-stage work will be on expanding the current algorithms to become a full-fledged

We are the company behind WordPress.com, Jetpack, Tumblr, and WooCommerce. We’re looking for a Senior Data Analyst to join our Tumblr team.

Communication with and empathy for our colleagues is a key part of this job – curiosity about the puzzles they face is a requirement. Data can be unruly: you’ll need to be prepared to face uncertainty and provide your best guess sometimes – our work is as much about cleaning and testing the legacy pipeline as it is about crafting excellent reporting and solving business problems.

As a Senior Data Scientist/Analyst you will:
Build data pipelines and reports that deliver meaningful insights to our product and business teams.
Always be raising data quality. That includes auditing sources, documenting issues, driving resolutions together with other teams, and implementing well-documented, performant, and tested transformations.
Perform ad hoc analyses to better understand customer behavior, needs, and individual test results.
Summarize data and investigation through the presentation, dashboard, and other mediums.
Partner with many other teams such as product, engineering teams to provide deep insights about business and product.
Build and improve analytics infrastructure such as ETL pipeline, A/B testing system, and data visualization systems.
We’d love to hear from you if:
You have at least 2 years of experience with SQL.
You have at least 2 years of experience with Python.
You have used a data flow scheduling system like Airflow.
You have experience with a business intelligence platform: we use Looker and strongly prefer experience with that platform, but other platforms and an ability to learn can go a long way.
It will be a plus if you have some experience with Kubernetes and Docker.
You are comfortable working across teams to deliver analytics solutions and are familiar with common metrics for consumer products.
You have excellent verbal and written communication skills in English.
You’re able to communicate clearly with and about data to technical and non-technical partners.
You’re highly collaborative and experienced in working with business owners, executives, developers, and creatives to discuss data, strategy, and tests.

Lead Senior Data Scientist,$86K-$137K (Glassdoor Est.),"The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?

Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:


* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.

* You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.

* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.

* You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.

* You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:


* Lead Senior Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.

* Lead Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.

* Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to own problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.

* Lead Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct people-management, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:


* You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.

* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

* You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role, including leading large and impactful technical projects. You may have an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

* You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Data Scientist,$86K-$137K (Glassdoor Est.),"Our client is on a mission to generate consistently highly accurate fundamentals predictions at large scale on companies, industries and economies using massive amounts of relevant data and machine learning, and to use these predictions to inform scalable, fully- automated business decisions making.

Powered by technology, we live in an increasingly fast-moving global society. With trends bubbling and fading fast, consumer behaviour is more mutable and supply chains more dynamic than ever before. Rapidly shifting trends give rise to growing swathes of data which require scalable machinery to constantly capture, cleanse, aggregate, retrieve, map, and connect.

They believe that conventional analytical methods lack the ability to take advantage of relevant and large data sets thus limit forecast accuracy. Current business decision making approaches are human-driven, fraught with bias and emotion, rely on spreadsheet analysis, one- dimensional data sets, and focus on a narrow range of aspects. This suboptimal approach provides an opportunity for disruption.

Our client's homegrown, scalable, and smart data platform continuously processes and interconnects tens of billions of data records daily from a diverse and growing number of publicly-available data sources. They apply state-of-the-art machine learnings algorithms to make accurate business, industry, and economic predictions. Our prediction horizon ranges from a few days to a few years. We are unburdening humans of the manual job of making sense of endlessly growing volumes of data and passing this responsibility onto machines. They believe their automated processes bring significant efficiencies in prediction fundamentals and driving better decision making.

Senior Data Scientist - Behavioral Health,$106K-$143K (Glassdoor Est.),"About us:
Grand Rounds is a new kind of healthcare company. Founded in 2011, the company is on a mission to raise the standard of healthcare for everyone, everywhere. The Grand Rounds team goes above and beyond to connect and guide people to the highest quality healthcare available for themselves and their loved ones. Grand Rounds creates products and services that give people the best possible healthcare experience. Named a 2019 Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and Rock Health’s 2018 Fastest Growing Company, Grand Rounds works with inspiring employers and doctors to empower them to be the change agents we need to make our shared vision a reality.

The Role:
Data Scientists at Grand Rounds work on problems that are core to the company’s mission. Major challenges include developing systems and models to identify the highest quality doctors in the country as well as methodologies to uncover the subtle differences between each physician’s clinical expertise. Additionally, patient-level modeling allows us to understand the specific healthcare needs of every person. With a high fidelity understanding of both patients and physicians we are able to route patients to both appropriate and high quality care.

In addition to developing the company’s core technologies, data scientists provide decision support analysis for many teams across the organization including product development, sales, marketing, and strategy. Data scale ranges from small data sets that fit on a single laptop to large multi-terabyte clinical information in distributed database systems.

This particular role within the Data Science team will focus on building our behavioral health (BH) related services. The US will be short over 16,000 psychiatrists by 2025, not to mention limitations of other types of BH providers, and the availability/access to/quality of the existing providers. Further, members with BH needs often have other physical conditions and the coexistence of BH needs with chronic conditions may 2-3x the costs of care. This role will use a mixture of structured data and text based data (Natural Language Processing skills a plus) to help identify members’ needs, match members to top providers, and determine which BH providers have the experience in particular domains. It is also a highly cross-functional role, as you will work closely with our Clinical and Product teams to help support our members’ needs during these difficult times.

We are looking for someone with strong NLP experience on difficult applications that recognizes the importance of maintaining a balance between cutting edge techniques and simple, scalable solutions. Having experience in the Behavioral Health space is strongly desired.
Example Projects include:
Predict who may have a BH need. A member’s care can be greatly enhanced if a clinician is aware of BH risks or needs of the member they are speaking with. However, because BH is faced with a negative stigma in the United States or a member just may not know to bring it up, the member may not discuss their BH needs with the clinician. If we can determine BH associated risks that our members face, our clinicians can professionally ask relevant questions to better treat, guide, and route members through the health care system. We strive to build NLP tools and systems to mine our rich text-based data to determine the types of BH risks/needs our members may have. We use the minimum necessary de-identified data to derive insights, and these insights are presented only to the treating professionals.

BH provider quality modeling. Unfortunately, not all providers are equal. Due to differences in judgment, training, and prior experience we find that there is a huge range in the clinical outcomes they can drive. Further, as different providers have different expertise, it is a non-trivial problem to determine which patients are best treated by which providers. Grand Rounds is a leader in the field of determining clinical quality, and we hope to further extend our tooling and modeling expertise to additional aspects of BH. Instead of just going to a generic in-network provider, this effort will help route our members to providers with a proven track record in the specific area of their need.
Responsibilities:
Help imagine and then create the Grand Rounds Behavioral Health offering
Help build the tooling to make sense of rich, largely untapped data assets, including text-based data
Lead and develop major projects from end-to-end encompassing planning, design, technical implementation, debugging, roll-out to Product & Engineering, testing, and iteration
Operate at level of sophistication in statistics, machine learning, or computer science that is publication-worthy
Regularly monitor pull requests, perform code reviews, and produce excellent peer reviews on projects prior to shipping to Product & Engineering
Evaluate and experiment with new technologies and tools prior to wider adoption by the team
Work closely with analysts, data scientists, product managers, clinicians, and engineers
Qualifications:
BS with 8+ years or MS with 6+ years or PhD with 3+ years of experience. Degree(s) should be in a technical discipline such as Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Math, quantitative social science
Work experience leading complex Data Science and Engineering projectsExperience with NLP techniques for text representation (e.g. n-grams, sentiment analysis, bag of words, vectorization, etc.), semantic extraction / named entity recognition, annotation, summarization, relation extraction, and intent recognition. Conversational agent experience is a a plus.
Experience with SQL relational databases as well as big dataRequired: Python, SQL, linux shell scripting
Frequent user of cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform
Excellent verbal communications, including the ability to clearly and concisely articulate complex concepts to both technical and non-technical collaborators
Business intuition and product sense that help you identify the most impactful projects to work on to address current and future business needs

We are Migo, and we are on a mission to change this by re-inventing the way people access and use credit.

Through a simple API integration to our platform, companies can enable their customers to make purchases and pay bills on credit, or get personal loans. Leveraging proprietary datasets, Migo builds ML algorithms on customer phone records, bank records, and payment transactions to assess credit risk, enabling us to offer credit lines to individuals and small businesses. This credit line can be used to make purchases from a merchant or withdraw cash without the need for point-of-sale hardware or plastic cards.

WHY ADS?

Roblox creators run ads to help users discover their games. Many creators, in early development stages, are able to quickly assess their potential success and further investment in a game by driving user traffic into their game via the ads product. The system has worked well while being relatively unmaintained and the team now plans to double down and focus on building out a quality Roblox-ecosystem ad platform.

In the future, we see the ads platform as a way for businesses to participate in the Roblox economy in deeply immersive creative experiences.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Senior Data Scientist - Optimization,$150K-$236K (Glassdoor Est.),"ENERGY INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION

The trillion dollar energy industry is undergoing a disruptive transformation. Energy generation is going from centralized to decentralized. Utilities are shifting from vertically integrated power producers and distributors (think PG&E; SoCal Edison) to nimbler energy services providers operating in increasingly deregulated environments. New generation assets are smaller in scale, distributed, powered through renewable sources, and owned by the customers. This shift will lead to over $10 Trillion in new energy investments by 2040. With this dramatic change, energy providers must run their business in new ways. Energy providers of the future will be data-driven, where effective use of data will determine who wins and who loses.

Enter AutoGrid
